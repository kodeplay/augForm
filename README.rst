 AugForm JQuery Plugin
=======================

AugForm is a `jQuery<http://jquery.com>`_. plugin for quickly adding the functionality of "growing" to
html forms, ie. the user can add and remove fields from the form to increase or decrease the size of the form.
For eg. Forms for saving meta data. <br/> <br/>
A Form generated by `Django<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.
`Formset<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/forms/formsets/>`._
would be a good example of this. In fact, it can be easily used with Django Formset using the
templateHandler.

Basic Example
-------------
Here is a basic example which does not use any templateHandler to start with.
Both adding and removing of fields is taken care of. Notice that after clicking on add field once, a delete button
appears on hover. This is because set the option 'min' to 1 ::

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("#custom-handler-example").augForm({
                    itemElem: 'li',
                    addBtn: '#addBtn',
                    min: 1,
                    tmplHandler: false,
                    onAdd: function () {
                        $tmpl = $("#attr-block-tmpl").clone();
                        $tmpl.removeAttr('id').removeAttr('style');
                        $tmpl.find('input').removeAttr('disabled');
                        $("#custom-handler-example").append($('<li><div class="rm-block">x</div></li>').append($tmpl));
                    }
            });

Here, 
    - `itemElem` is the element that will repeat when a new formset is added to the form. Usually,
      this will be `li` or `td` element.
    - `addBtn` is the element on click of which the new formset will be added
    - `min` is the min number of formsets required. It will be used to restrict deletion of formsets 
    - `tmplHandler` is how adding of formsets will be handled. Two built-in tmplHandlers are 
       * htmlAsString
       * djangoFormSet
    - `onAdd` is a function that will be called after tmplHandler's onAdd is called.
       Note that it will not overwrite the tmplHandler's onAdd functionality
